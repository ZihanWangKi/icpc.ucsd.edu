Welcome to the homepage for competitive programming at UCSD. We are a
student-org organized to help students learn techniques for solving problems 
with computer algorithms and to compete in algorithmic programming competitions.

Our primary focus is preparing for and competing in the yearly
[International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest).
We compete in the [SoCal ICPC region](http://socalcontest.org/current/index.shtml), and teams can advance to the 
[North America Championship](https://nac.icpc.global/) and the [World Finals]((https://icpc.global/)).

The primary form of communication for the club is our
[Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/ucsdcp/signup), so join that for
updates.

This site is currently under heavy construction.
