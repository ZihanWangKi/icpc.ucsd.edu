Welcome to the homepage for Competitive Programming @ UCSD Student Org. We help students learn techniques for solving problems 
with computer algorithms and to compete in algorithmic programming competitions.

# Primary Focus 
Our primary focus is preparing for and competing in the yearly
[International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest).
We compete in the [SoCal ICPC region](http://socalcontest.org/current/index.shtml), and teams can advance to the 
[North America Championship](https://nac.icpc.global/) and eventually to the [World Finals]((https://icpc.global/)).
