- [cp-algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/) a website that contains dozens of implementations ofr useful algorithms

## Competition/Practices Sites
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com) This is one of the most famous, if not the most, competitive programming website.
  You can compete in online competitions, solve problems from huge problem bank, and learn from enormous useful blogs,
  [1](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/57282), [2](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/55274) are my favourites. 
  **This is also where our weekly contest happens. Please sign up to codeforces and join our [group](https://codeforces.com/group/GkFqAQKeYR/)**.
- [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com) hosts a great deal of official contests (you can find many regionals & world finals here).
